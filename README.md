RECOMMENDATION

-From the record gathered,i recommend getting more products from the manufacturers whose products are in higher demand because it shows how original there products are or how pocket friendly it is too.

-Also,new products should not be purchased in bulk until consumers have been familiar with it.

-companies should be made to give enough products that will serve as awareness to customers inorder to boost the speed of sales of new products.
